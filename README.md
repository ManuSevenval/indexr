# Indexr
Dynamic index modules for your Node or client packaged ES6 submodules.

<img src="docs/images/reducer-diagram.png?1" />

## Background

Good application architecture should be modular in terms of features. A common thing to do is to unify features with 'plumbing' code to load them together into arrays so they can be manipulated by a central process.

An example might be express routes. Say you have routes organised by feature like this:

```
app/modules
 ├── auth
 ├── errors
 ├── home
 ├── product
 └── user
```

As a good engineer you would then write plumbing code that looks like this:

```javascript
/* app/modules/index.js */
import auth from './auth';
import errors from './errors';
import home from './home';
import product from './product';
import user from './user';

export default [
  auth,
  errors,
  home,
  product,
  user,
];
```

So you can then them load them to express like this:

```javascript
/* app/index.js */
import routes from './modules';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// Apply all routes from within the routes folder
routes.map((route) => {
  app.use(route);
});

```

So that is all great but what if you forget to update your index all the time (like I do) and/or have dynamic modules that really should be autoloaded?

You can try something like this in your modules folder:

```javascript
// ./routes/index.js
export default fs
  .readdirSync(moduleFolder)
  .filter((listing) => {
    try {
      return fs.statSync(p).isDirectory()
        && fs.statSync(path.resolve(p, 'index.js')).isFile();
    } catch (e) {
      return false;
    }
  })
  .map((listing) => {
    return require(path.resolve(moduleFolder, listing))
  });
```

This works but there are problems with this.
* ES6 imports are declarative and meant for static analysis.
* The function `require` is actually from the commonjs API and is not part of the ES6 modules spec and will eventually be deprecated.
* You probably don't want your app to be synchronously blocking
* If you try to code this asynchronously the rest of your code will be in a callback which is annoying.

Simply put ES6 modules [cannot be dynamic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30340005/importing-modules-using-es6-syntax-and-dynamic-path).

That doesn't stop us needing to load things simply and dynamically, does it?

**Indexr** is designed to solve this problem by automatically generating index root modules from submodules that live in your source path.

# Installation

Install globally and use indexr in the bash prompt.

```bash
npm install indexr -g
```

Install locally and use the node API or use indexr in npm scripts (recommended).

```bash
npm install indexr --save
```

## Tip
Try adding `./node_modules/.bin` to your path for your terminal. That way you can get access to local cli programs as you enter your npm projects.

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile
...
PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin
...
```

# Usage

You can use indexr as either a command-line program or a node API.

Assuming we have a folder tree like this:

```bash
./modules
 ├── bar
 ├── baz
 └── foo
```

We run this in the root:

```bash
$ indexr .
```

Within any subfolder it finds called 'modules' you will find it will create a file called `./index.r.js` that contains the following:

```javascript
/**
  This file is autogenerated by indexr.
  Check this file into source control.
  Do not edit this file.
  For more information: http://github.com/ryardley/indexr
**/
import foo from './foo';
import bar from './bar';
import baz from './baz';
export default [
  foo,
  bar,
  baz
];
/** End autogenerated content **/
```
## CLI Usage

For help with the commandline program you can try the help flag:

```
$ indexr --help

  Usage: indexr <rootFolder> [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                output usage information
    -V, --version             output the version number
    -e --ext <string>         Remove this extension from imports.
    -o --out <filename>       The name of the output file.
    -d --direct-import        Directly import files as opposed to folders.
    -m --modules <string>     Glob string that determine which folders hold modules.
    -5 --es5                  Use ES5 template for index output.
    -n --named-exports        Use named exports instead of arrays.
    -s --submodules <string>  Glob string that determine which folders are modules.
    -w --watch [string]       Files to watch as a glob string.
```

### Examples

#### NOTE: All commandline globs must be enclosed in quotes!!

The following example will look in the `./app` folder for modules folders identified by '**/modules/' and then identify submodules given by '*/server.js' and use them to write a file to `./app/modules/server.js`.

```bash
$ indexr ./app --out 'server.js' --modules '**/modules/' --submodules '*/server.js'
```

### Change the modules folder

We can change the glob used to find the modules folder which is useful if you don't want to have your modules under 'modules'.

```bash
$ indexr . --modules '**/features/'
```

### Change the output filename

We can change the output filename of the file indexr produces.

```bash
$ indexr . --out 'index.js'
```

### Change what qualifies as a module.

We can also filter which modules and entry files we want by setting some options. the following will only include modules which contain `server.js` files.

```bash
$ indexr . --submodules '*/reducer.js'
```

### ES5 module output

```bash
$ indexr . --es5
```

If the es5 flag is set Indexr can export the template in es5/common js style.

```javascript
/**
  This file is autogenerated by indexr.
  Check this file into source control.
  Do not edit this file.
  For more information: http://github.com/ryardley/indexr
**/
var foo = require('./foo');
var bar = require('./bar');
var baz = require('./baz');
module.exports = [foo, bar, baz];
/** End autogenerated content **/
```

### Including the globbed files.

By using the `--direct-import` flag it will include the searched files specifically in the import statements:

```bash
$ indexr . --submodules '*/server.js' --direct-import
```

```javascript
import foo from './foo/server.js';
import bar from './bar/server.js';
export default [foo, bar];
```

## File Watching

You can watch files using the `--watch` flag:

```bash
$ indexr . --watch
```


## Node API

### Signature

```typescript
indexr(rootFolder:String, options?:Object):Promise
```

### Arguments

| argument            | notes                     |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| rootFolder          | The root folder to work from. |
| options             | An object containing configuration options  |

### Available options

| option         | default | notes |
| -------------- | ------  | -----------|
| es5            | false | Boolean flag to use es5 commonjs style modules over es6. This is overridden if a template function|
| directImport   | false | Include the searched files in the import statements. |
| exts           | [] | Remove this extension from the imported files. Useful if you would prefer to import "./foo/server" instead of "./foo/server.js" |
| modules        | '\*\*/modules/' | A glob or array of globs pathed to the rootFolder that will determine which folders are module holders. If this is ommitted defaults to "**/modules/". |
| namedExports   | false |   This flag will ensure that indexes use named exports instead of arrays. |
| submodules     | '\*/' | A glob pathed to each module holder folder that will determine which submodules are imported to the index. Defaults to "*/index.js" |
| template       | indexrs es6 template | A template function the function should takes an array of relative module paths and output the module file as a string |
| outputFilename | 'index.r.js' | The name of the output file. This file will be added to each module folder. |
| watch          | false | Either a boolean value or a glob that represents files for chokdir to watch. |

### Example

Here is an example

```javascript
import indexr from 'indexr';
import es6 from 'indexr/dist/modules/template/es6'; // This will change don't do this.

indexr(__dirname, {
  es5: false,
  modules: '**/modules/',
  submodules: '*/index.js',
  directImport: true,
  exts: ['js', 'jsx'],
  namedExports: false,
  outputFilename: 'index.js',
  template: es6, // or some function that takes an array of module paths and spits out a template
  watch: false,
})
.then((err, result) => {
  console.log('Files have been indexed!');
});
```

*NOTE: dont load the template from the dist file as it's location may change. This is only for illustration purposes.*
